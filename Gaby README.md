Gabriela's contributions have been creating the pre-generated posts for each category and verifying that the user wants to upload their post. Gabriela has also designed the poster, which was submitted for Chapman University's Student Scholar Research Symposium. Lastly, Gabriela created the docker and requirements file necessary to running the twitface program. 

After multiple attempts to get approval from the Twitter API to write to a user's profile, we were unsuccessful. While the verification process was a success, API access was not. Neither of us were able to come up with a solution to this problem.
